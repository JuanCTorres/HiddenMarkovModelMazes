# Hidden Markov Model Mazes

## Requirements

### Python version
`python>=3.5` (infix matrix multiplication operator `@` introduced in this version).

### Python packages
`numpy 1.13.3` (not tested with previous versions)

## How to run testing code

```cd src && python3 HMM.py``` (not `cd`ing into `src` results in the input files not being found. This can be solved by 
using an absolute path in testing. In the future, perhaps).
